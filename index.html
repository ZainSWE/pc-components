        <h2>About: Why choose parts?</h2>
        <p>
            Computers can come in many different shapes and sizes,
            which can be a double edged sword in the world of pc building.
            So to help, I've created a website that allows you to browse some
            of the latest pc parts available in the market.
        </p>
        <h2>Guide: What parts do I pick?</h2>
        <p>
            Before you go on to browse/buy different parts, it's imperative that you
            understand what each part does and how it can affect your overall pc build.
            Below you will find the most common parts for building a computer that 
            follows recent standards and needs of certain components, rather than getting
            overloaded with information about outdated hardware.

                <h3>Motherboard</h3>
                <p>
                    The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects every part of your PC.
                    It decides what CPU and RAM types you can use, how many M.2 SSDs and PCIe cards
                    you can install, and how power is delivered to the components. Today look for
                    the right CPU socket, DDR5 support, enough M.2/PCIe lanes, and solid VRMs for
                    reliability and future upgrades.

                <h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
                <p>
                    The CPU is the brain of the computer. It runs programs and handles most
                    calculations. Modern CPUs have multiple cores and threads, and higher single-core
                    speed (IPC/boost) helps in everyday tasks and games. Some CPUs include
                    integrated graphics for basic displays without a separate GPU.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h3>
                <p>
                    The GPU renders images, videos, and 3D graphics. It matters most for gaming,
                    video editing, and AI-related tasks. Modern GPUs have dedicated memory (VRAM),
                    support hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and use features like upscaling (AI
                    image reconstruction) to boost performance.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3>
                <p>
                    RAM holds the data programs use right now. More RAM lets you run more apps
                    at once and handle larger files. Speed and latency matter, and DDR5 is common
                    today. Pick enough capacity (16GB+ for most users, 32GB+ for heavy multitasking
                    or content creation).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>SSD (Solid State Drive)</h3>
                <p>
                    SSDs store your files and the operating system. NVMe PCIe SSDs are much faster
                    than old SATA drives, making the system boot and apps load quickly. Look for
                    NVMe (PCIe 4.0/5.0) for speed and check endurance (TBW) for long-term use.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>PSU (Power Supply Unit)</h3>
                <p>
                    The PSU provides stable power to every component. Choose one with enough
                    wattage for your CPU+GPU, an 80 Plus efficiency rating (Bronze/Silver/Gold+),
                    and good protections. Modular cables help keep your build tidy.
                </p>

                <h3>Air Cooler</h3>
                <p>
                    An air cooler uses a heatsink and fan to move heat away from the CPU. It's
                    reliable, quiet on many models, and great for most builds, especially mid-
                    range systems that don't need extreme cooling.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>AIO Cooler (All In One)</h3>
                <p>
                    An AIO is a closed-loop liquid cooler: a pump, radiator, and fans in one
                    package. It can cool high-performance CPUs better and often looks cleaner,
                    but costs more and requires space for the radiator.
